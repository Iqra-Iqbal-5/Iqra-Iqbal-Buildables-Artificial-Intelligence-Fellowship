        "### Question 1\n",
        "**What is prompting?**  \n",
        "Answer: Prompting is the practice of giving instructions to a generative AI tool in a clear and structured way so it produces the results you want. A good prompt includes elements like task, persona, format, context, and references. The better and more thoughtful the inputs, the better the outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Question 2\n",
        "**In the following prompt, which part describes the primary task?**  \n",
        "Prompt: *‚ÄúExplain how car batteries work using non-technical language that someone without any mechanical knowledge could understand and interpret.‚Äù*  \n",
        "Answer: The primary task in the prompt is to ‚Äúexplain how car batteries work.‚Äù In addition to this task, the prompt sets specific constraints: the explanation must use non-technical language and it should be understandable for someone without mechanical knowledge. This also highlights the intended audience, which is beginners or laypeople rather than experts. The style and tone are implied to be simple, clear, and accessible so that the outcome is not just an explanation, but one that can be easily interpreted and understood by the reader.\n",
        "### Question 3\n",
        "**When you are using a gen AI tool to create a healthy three-course menu that requires a certain number of calories, which prompting element will ensure the menu is more practical?**  \n",
        "Answer:  The prompting element that makes the menu more practical is context. The task only tells the AI to create a healthy three-course menu, but without more details it may be too general. Context adds important information like the required number of calories, dietary needs, and health goals. This makes the menu realistic and useful. Other elements such as persona, format, references, and evaluation can help improve clarity and presentation, but they do not make the menu practical in the same way that context does\n",
        "### Question 4\n",
        "**Prompting with audio to receive a visual representation is called what?**  \n",
        "Answer: Prompting with audio to receive a visual representation is called multimodal prompting. This type of prompting combines more than one mode of input, such as sound, text, or images. In this case, the audio serves as the input, and the AI generates a visual response from it. Multimodal prompting is useful because it allows richer interactions and more practical outputs across different forms of media. It is becoming an important feature in advanced AI tools.\n",
        "### Question 5\n",
        "**What does a human-in-the-loop approach to prompting emphasize?**  \n",
        "Answer: A human-in-the-loop approach emphasizes that AI outputs must always be verified and refined by a human before use. It ensures accuracy, fairness, and responsibility by fact-checking, cross-referencing, and reducing bias, since AI can produce errors or hallucinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Question 6\n",
        "**When the initial prompt \"Create a dataset\" is too broad, what should you do to refine it?**  \n",
        "Answer: You should iterate and refine the prompt by adding more details, breaking it into smaller tasks, or introducing constraints. For example, instead of simply saying ‚ÄúCreate a dataset,‚Äù you could say: ‚ÄúCreate a dataset of 100 rows with three columns: customer name, age, and city.‚Äù This makes the task specific and actionable.\n"

They can also help me achieve goals by teaching new skills, giving targeted feedback, or collaborating on complex tasks like proposals or campaign plans. This support would save time, boost confidence, and improve the quality of my work and personal growth.\n"
